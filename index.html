  <p>
    my name is tyson horvath, and i am a 25 year-old passionate software developer, currently living in sweden. i have a
    master's degree in computer science and i am currently employed for Opera Software, the browser company.
    fun fact, i wrote my first program in 2011, when i was only 11 years old! while i have a broad interest in various
    aspects of computer science, i
    have developed a particular fascination with compilers, language
    construction, and operating systems. beyond my love for programming, i
    am a people person. i like meeting new people and collaborating on
    projects.
